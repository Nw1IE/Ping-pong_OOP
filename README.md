**Descriptions**

Hello everyone, the game Ping pong, a mini game should work stably, everything should move so that the objects
hit the ball

**Rules**

The game continues until 11 points. 12 If the score is 10:10, then the game goes until one of the players has an advantage of 2 points.
Each player serves only 2 serves in a row, then the serves go to the opponent. When serving, the ball must be thrown to a height of at least 16 cm.
The serve is performed in front of the table, that is, the toss of the ball and the moment the racket hits the ball must occur in front of the table, without going beyond the line of the table.

If the ball hits the net during the serve, but all other rules were observed, a "re-serve" is performed - the server must repeat the serve. 12 The number of re-serves is not limited.
The receiver must hit the ball to the server's half, directing it over the net after the first contact with the table surface on his side. If a player hits the ball in the air before it touches the table on his side, a foul is called, the point is awarded to the opponent
